# Placement Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms

This project focuses on predicting the placement outcomes of students or candidates using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to determine whether a student will be placed in a job or not based on various input features.

## Algorithms Used

- Decision Tree: A decision tree creates a tree-like model of decisions and their consequences. It partitions the feature space based on input attributes and constructs a tree structure for prediction.

- Random Forest: Random forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees. It creates an ensemble of trees and aggregates their predictions to make the final placement prediction.

- Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is a statistical model used for binary classification tasks. It predicts the probability of an instance belonging to a specific class, making it suitable for placement prediction.

## Dataset

To begin, a dataset is collected that includes relevant information about students or candidates, such as academic performance, skills, experience, and other influencing factors. The dataset is then divided into training and testing sets.

## Training and Evaluation

The training set is used to train the machine learning models using the decision tree, random forest, and logistic regression algorithms. These algorithms learn from the training data and create models that can predict placement outcomes.

The testing set is used to evaluate the performance of the models. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score can be used to assess the effectiveness of each algorithm in predicting placements.

## Results and Conclusion

The project aims to provide insights into which machine learning algorithm performs best for placement prediction based on the given dataset. The results can guide educational institutions and recruitment agencies in making informed decisions about student placement and job predictions.
